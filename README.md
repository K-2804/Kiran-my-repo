Electricity Price Prediction

#Overview
This project is a data science application that predicts electricity prices based on historical data and relevant features. The predictive model can be used by energy providers, consumers, and grid operators to make informed decisions regarding electricity consumption, investment, and market participation.
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the code on your local machine.

#Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive exploration)
- Required Python packages 
You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install package_name

#Data
The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `/data` directory. It should include the following files:
- `electricity_price_data.csv`: Historical electricity price data with timestamps.
- Other relevant data files as needed.

# Running the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/K-2804/Kiran-my-repo.git
2. Prepare the data:
   - Place the required data files in the `electicity_price_data` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
4. Open the `electricity_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter interface and follow the instructions to execute the code cells.

#Usage
The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed code and explanations for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Customize the code as needed and explore the predictions.

#Dependencies
The project relies on several Python packages. You can install them using pip:
pip install package_name
